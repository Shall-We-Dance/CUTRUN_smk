# Snakemake workflow for CUT&RUN Upstream Analysis

This repository contains a modular and scalable Snakemake workflow for analyzing CUT&RUN data.

## Features

- 🧠 **Automatic Sample Detection**  
  Supports various naming conventions including `_R1.fastq.gz`, `_1.fastq.gz`, `.fastq.gz`, etc.

- 🔁 **SE/PE Mode Auto-Detection**  
  Automatically routes samples through the correct pipeline depending on whether data is single-end or paired-end.

- 🎛️ **Customizable Configuration**  
  Centralized `config.yaml` for specifying input paths, threading, STAR index, repeat BED file, and more.

- 🔍 **Repeat Masking (Optional)**  
  If enabled in the config, `bedtools` will be used to filter out alignments overlapping repeat regions.

- 📊 **BigWig Generation**  
  Supports BAM-to-bigWig conversion with and without normalization (e.g., RPKM).

## Workflow Overview

1. **Sample Detection**  
   Automatically detects sample names based on filename patterns.

2. **Quality Trimming**  
   Uses `fastp` to trim adapters and filter reads.

3. **Alignment**  
   Maps reads to the reference genome using `STAR`.

4. **Repeat Masking (Optional)**  
   Removes reads overlapping with specified repeat regions.

5. **BigWig Conversion**  
   Converts BAM files to bigWig tracks for visualization.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shall-We-Dance/CUTRUN_smk.git
cd CUTRUN_smk
```

2. Edit `config.yaml` to specify your paths and parameters.

3. Activate Snakemake and run the pipeline:

```bash
snakemake --use-conda --cores 16
```
