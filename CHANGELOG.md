# Changelog

## [v1.1.0] - 2025-05-14

### ðŸš€ Performance Improvements
- Default CPU threads changed from `max/8` â†’ `max/4` for more efficient usage on multi-core systems.
- Enabled multi-threading in all `samtools` steps via `-@ {threads}`.

### ðŸŽ¯ Multi-Mapping Support
- `--outSAMmultNmax` in STAR increased from `1` to `100`, improving retention of multi-mapped reads.
- Introduced `multimap_weight` function to post-process alignments with `NH` tags, preparing for downstream MACS3 integration.

### ðŸ“Š BigWig Generation
- `--samFlagExclude 1024` added to `bamCoverage` to exclude PCR duplicates from signal tracks.
- New `filter_blacklist` option in `config.yaml`:  
  When set to `true`, automatically downloads and applies ENCODE blacklist BED files (based on genome) during bigWig generation with `--blackListFileName`.

### ðŸ§¼ Cleanup & Removal
- Deprecated `mask_repeats` step. Use `filter_blacklist` instead for repeat/artefact exclusion.

### ðŸ§  Usability Enhancements
- `detect_samples` now supports filenames like `*_R1_001.fq.gz`, improving compatibility with common Illumina naming formats.

### ðŸ§¬ Peak Calling
- Integrated **MACS3** for peak calling from aligned BAM files.
